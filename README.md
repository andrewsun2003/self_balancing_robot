# MINHO: Self-Balancing Robot

## Overview
This project documents the design, development, and control of **MINHO**, a compact self-balancing robot created for ENGMT380. The robot demonstrates autonomous balancing, obstacle avoidance, and maze navigation through the use of gyroscope and ultrasonic sensors, PID control, and dynamic motor actuation.

## Tasks Implemented

### ðŸŒ€ Task 1: Balance
- Implemented PID control using gyro Y-axis angle.
- Tuned PID gains to maintain upright position.
- Limited integral windup and current draw.

### ðŸš§ Task 2: Obstacle Avoidance
- Tilt angle shifted forward to induce motion.
- Ultrasonic sensor used to detect walls within 25 cm.
- Turns implemented via differential PWM.
- Sampling delay added to prevent overcurrent faults.

### ðŸ§­ Task 3: Maze Navigation
- Used ultrasonic sensor and Z-axis angle for path correction.
- Predefined Z-angle array allowed approximate directional compensation.
- Adaptive turn logic using gyro and encoder feedback.

## Limitations
- Navigation success is sensitive to **initial orientation** due to predefined Z-angle path logic.
- **Gyro drift** over time affects long-run accuracy.
- The rear-mounted **claw** introduces unintended backwards drift during transitions.

## Future Improvements
- Implement **dynamic feedback for Z-angle** using side-facing sensors.
- Periodic **gyro recalibration** using known wall distances.
- Redesign claw to reduce interference with turning.
